/*
This program simulates a BattleShip game between the user and the computer, allowing
both the user and the computer to set up their ships and grenades and then giving
them each turns to rocket cells on the 8x8 game grid. When one of the players lose
all their ships, the game ends, all positions are displayed and the user is given
the option to either play again, or exit the program.

This is the driver class of my user vs. computer battleship game. It is responsible 
for running the gameplay loop (main method), and handling the gameplay logic.
